# simulation-of-realistic-network-traffic
Data traffic in computer networks is often generated at random times by end users. More randomness in packet transmission times is also introduced by the network nodes when they send/receive data. In order to simulate realistic traffic input to computer networks, we need to generate randomized test traffic similar to what is seen in reality.
